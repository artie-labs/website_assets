<p>Cascading changes are used as a way to ensure referential integrity between related tables. Referential integrity refers
to the fact that all references in a database are valid.</p>
<p>Consider the following table:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE parent(
    id INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE child(
    id        INT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent (id)
);

INSERT INTO parent (id) VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO child (id, parent_id) VALUES (1, 1), (2, 1);
</code></pre>
<p>Which would create tables that look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="img.png" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/artie-labs/website_assets/blogs/cascading_changes/img.png"/></p>
<ul>
<li>In the child table, we have rows that are referencing the parent table (id = 1). As this is set up with as a foreign
  key constraint, we cannot delete the parent row with id = 1 without first deleting the child rows that reference it.</li>
<li>However, with cascading deletes, we can delete the parent row and have the child rows automatically deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can use cascading changes to automatically apply certain actions to child tables based on what has occurred on the
parent table. In this blog, we'll do a deep dive of cascading changes and <strong>reasons why you shouldn't use them</strong>.</p>
<h2><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-link" href="#types-of-cascading-changes" id="types-of-cascading-changes" title="Permalink">#</a>Types of cascading changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cascading updates (ON UPDATE CASCADE)</li>
<li>Cascading deletes (ON DELETE CASCADE)</li>
</ul>
<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-link" href="#cascading-updates" id="cascading-updates" title="Permalink">#</a>Cascading updates</h3>
<p>Cascading updates will detect primary key updates and automatically update references in the child table. To enable
this, we would do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE child (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
</code></pre>
<p>If I then update the primary key of the parent, all the child references will be automatically updated.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">UPDATE parent SET id = 2 WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM child;
+----+-----------+
| id | parent_id |
+----+-----------+
|  1 |      2    |
|  2 |      2    |
+----+-----------+
</code></pre>
<p>In practice, we rarely would use cascading updates as we would try to avoid and minimize the amount of times we would
need to change a table's primary keys since it could impact external applications.</p>
<h3><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-link" href="#cascading-deletes" id="cascading-deletes" title="Permalink">#</a>Cascading deletes</h3>
<p>Cascading deletes will detect a delete in the parent table and automatically delete all the referenced child rows. To
enable this, we would do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">CREATE TABLE child (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    parent_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent(id) ON DELETE CASCADE 
);
</code></pre>
<p>With cascading deletes, if I deleted an entry from the parent, the respective child entries will be automatically
deleted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT * FROM child;
+----+-----------+
| id | parent_id |
+----+-----------+
|  1 |         1 |
|  2 |         1 |
+----+-----------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

DELETE FROM parent where id = 1;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

SELECT * FROM child;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

<p>The key differences are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/trigger-syntax.html">Database triggers</a> are more expressive than cascading changes, it can be used to execute arbitrary SQL statements based on specified database changes.</li>
<li>Changes from a database trigger will show up in binlogs, <strong>whereas cascading changes will not</strong>. This may be an important consideration if you are using log-based replication.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Cascading changes makes the database more susceptible to unintended changes</li>
<li>Deleting a record in the parent may trigger mass deletes to other child tables</li>
<li>You will most likely want to archive or soft delete the data instead of hard delete in order to keep it for historical purposes</li>
<li>It's extremely difficult to recover from an unintended delete as row changes will not appear in binlogs</li>
<li>If a deleted record has related records that needs to be deleted first, it's better to block and have users explicitly delete the dependent records first</li>
<li>For example: If you are an e-commerce company, and you delete a row in the <code>products</code> table and the <code>orders</code> table is set to cascade delete, you will lose all the order history for that product</li>
<li>It makes debugging more difficult as other team members may not be cognizant of it</li>
<li>Cascading changes are also bad for performance as it requires a serializable lock</li>
<li>A serializable lock will hold an exclusive lock on the resulting data and will block other transactions and queries from accessing the locked rows</li>
<li>This may lead to deadlocks and slow running queries</li>
</ul>

<p>To remove cascading changes, you will need to recreate the constraint, below is a snippet of how you would do it:</p>
<p>First, you'll need to find the foreign constraint name</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE 
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'child' AND COLUMN_NAME = 'parent_id';
+-----------------+
| CONSTRAINT_NAME |
+-----------------+
| child_ibfk_1    |
+-----------------+
1 row in set (0.01 sec)
</code></pre>
<p>Once you have the constraint name, we can recreate it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">START TRANSACTION;
-- (optional) Lock on the parent and child tables to prevent data changes
LOCK TABLES parent WRITE, child WRITE;

-- Drop the existing foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE child DROP FOREIGN KEY child_ibfk_1;

-- Recreate the constraint
ALTER TABLE child ADD CONSTRAINT child_table_ibfk_1 FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES parent (id);

-- Unlock the tables (if locked)
UNLOCK TABLES;
COMMIT;
</code></pre>
