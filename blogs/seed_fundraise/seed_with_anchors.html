 We are excited to announce that we have raised a $3.3M Seed round led by Exponent Founders Capital with participation from General Catalyst, Y Combinator, and many angel investors including Benn Stancil, Lenny Rachitsky, and Arash Ferdowsi.

 In early 2023, Robin Tang and I launched Artie with a vision to revolutionize how companies transfer data. 
Our mission is to make database replication real-time, reliable, and cost effective. Robin brings a wealth of experience, having previously scaled infrastructure at Opendoor, Zendesk, and several early stage startups. 
My background as an investor in public software companies complements his expertise, equipping us with a unique blend of technical and market insights.

 Artie syncs databases and data warehouses in real-time and in a reliable way. We created Artie because of a critical industry gap: the majority of companies are still utilizing batched ETL (extract, transform, load) processes to sync data. 
Traditional batch ETLs not only introduce data lag in the data warehouse, hindering real-time analytics and operational use cases, but also result in data consistency and scalability issues.
</p>
<p>
 Artie is unique in its use of change data capture (CDC) and streaming technology to sync data, along with the ability to automatically handle schema evolution in-flight. 
This approach ensures high data integrity while dramatically reducing latency to seconds. It is also more cost-effective by eliminating the need to process large batches of data. 
Our solution empowers customers to operationalize their data warehouse and generate more timely, impactful insights.
</p>
<p>
 We were lucky to work with Substack, a leading subscription network, as our first customer. Substack previously used batched ETLs to move production data from their databases into Snowflake. 
These batches would transfer data every few hours or even overnight. This delayed their data analysts’ ability to analyze experiment data and initiate new workflows, which lowered overall organizational productivity. 
After implementing Artie, data lag was slashed dramatically to a mere 10-15 seconds. Substack’s A/B testing framework now measures much faster and data integrity also improved. 
The result is a tangible acceleration in decision-making processes across the entire company.

<p>
 One common misconception about real-time streaming is its presumed higher cost compared to batch processing. 
Our experience with customers tells a different story: not only do they benefit from real-time data, but they often also see a reduction in total cost of ownership. 
This is particularly true for companies with large volumes of data. 
While not immediately intuitive, processing smaller amounts of data continuously using Snowflake’s virtual data warehouse requires less computational power than ingesting bulk data every 1-2 hours. 
As such, customers often report a noticeable reduction in Snowflake costs after switching to Artie.
</p>
<p>
 Who benefits from real-time data? A wide range of industries. Fintechs, for instance, rely on it for risk analysis and transaction monitoring. 
Ecommerce companies use real-time data to monitor inventory levels, optimize warehouse logistics, and iterate on experiments. 
For advertising agencies, the use of real-time marketing analytics enhances campaign effectiveness and the ability to personalize outreach. 
Furthermore, companies employing AI models for incremental or online machine learning depend on access to the latest production data. 
The importance of real-time data escalates even more when companies provide analytical dashboards to their customers. 
While internal BI teams might manage with some data delay, expecting customers to endure even brief lags in data is increasingly seen as unacceptable in today's fast-paced environment.

<p>
 We’ve achieved remarkable growth. Within just six months we scaled from processing zero to over 30 billion rows of data. 
We are now serving over 10 enterprise customers and have experienced significant revenue growth of mid double digits month-over-month in the past few months. 
With the infusion of new funding, we plan to expand the team to support our pipeline of high-growth and innovative companies. To experience how real-time data can elevate your competitive edge,
