<p>Sleeping Duck is a retail company that designs, manufactures, and sells mattresses online. Core business and application data including sales transactions, inventory metrics, and website functionality logs are stored in their Postgres database. The data engineering team then transfers data to Snowflake to run analytics and power core business operations, which include monitoring website performance, predicting inventory needs, and managing warehouse logistics workflows.</p>
<p>Previously, Sleeping Duck used a batched ETL solution from a SaaS provider for their Postgres to Snowflake data replication. Observed data latency was ~1 hour which was not ideal for operational use cases. Chao Li, Senior Data Engineer at Sleeping Duck, wanted a better solution that was not only faster but offered the flexibility to enable real-time syncs on critical tables. He evaluated several solutions, including Fivetran, Stitch, Matillion, and Datorios, but none were as easy as Artie to set up. Most alternate solutions did not provide the level of support he wanted and required hands-on maintenance, which was not ideal for his small team of engineers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Working with Artie was exceptionally positive. Their genuine attentiveness to our needs distinguished them from other vendors. The onboarding process was smooth and the team promptly addressed any issues that came up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sleeping Duck chose Artie for database replication for several key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artie <strong>reduced data latency from 1 hour to 15 minutes</strong>, a four-fold increase in critical business data updates without an increase in Snowflake compute costs. Importantly, Artie offered the ability to stream data in real-time, which helps future proof the needs of the business as new use cases come up.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.artie.so/blogs/snowflake-eco-mode">Artie’s Eco Mode</a> provides the ability to adjust replication frequency based on time-of-day demands. Sleeping Duck mostly leverages 15 minute syncs during peak business hours and 6 hour syncs outside of business hours when data analysts/engineers are not utilizing the data. <strong>This feature helped reduce Snowflake ingestion costs by 51%!</strong></li>
<li>Plug and play solution. The <strong>ease of implementation and zero maintenance requirements</strong> was a big factor in choosing Artie. In addition, the <a href="https://www.artie.so/blogs/introducing-arties-analytics-portal">Analytics Portal</a> provides unparalleled visibility into usage and latency. The monitors on database and data pipeline health also helps Sleeping Duck’s data team proactively manage issues.</li>
<li>Robust technical support. The Artie team’s genuine attentiveness to customer’s technical needs and ability to go above and beyond to help solve customer’s problems.</li>

Many departments, including Customer Experience, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain teams leverage production data for daily business workflows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artie has become an indispensable tool for us. Alternatives might exist, but they would likely result in increased costs and a diminished user experience, as data dashboard refresh rates across teams would be slower.</p>
