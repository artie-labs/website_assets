<p>Keep, a Canadian credit card and payments company, uses Artie to sync business-critical production data from Postgres and MongoDB into Snowflake in real-time. With Artie, the team was able to move operational dashboards to Snowflake and decrease query load on their production databases. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Artie has been a foundational component of building our data stack. As a data-driven fintech startup, we wanted all the benefits of fast and reliable database replication, without having to invest months of engineering time to build and maintain a robust pipeline. We now can focus on building products that our customers love.</p>

<p>Keep is growing rapidly and needed to move analytics functions off of their production databases. The data team wanted a centralized source of truth for all their data that sits across Postgres, MongoDB, and Segment.</p>
<p>They ultimately chose to use Snowflake as their data warehouse and use Metabase to create dashboards to track business-critical KPIs that help inform day-to-day workflows across product, engineering, sales, and business operations teams.</p>
<p>Data ingestion is, of course, a key component of getting the data they need into Snowflake. Helson Taveras, co-founder and CTO of Keep, knew he did not want their engineering team to build data pipelines in-house. They wanted engineering to stay focused on building a great product that helps differentiate them from their competitors, instead of building and managing data pipelines. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Artie team went above and beyond, even offering suggestions on database configurations to help us maintain a healthy infrastructure environment. They were a lifesaver and helped us avoid issues around running out of disk space in our Postgres WAL, which would have been disastrous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Helson Taveras wanted a no-code ETL solution that they can easily set up and never have to manage. The team evaluated several SaaS ETL solutions and chose Artie for several key reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ease of use. Setting up a connector took only 10 minutes and was extremely straightforward. Artie also offers real-time pipeline visibility into rows synced, ingestion lag, and replication slot size, among others.</li>
<li>Ability to support real-time use cases. As a data-driven team, Keep wants to operationalize their data, so they can make <strong>real-time decisions, such as credit underwriting and trust &amp; safety checks</strong>. These capabilities will <strong>lower risk on their platform and help increase customer trust</strong>. </li>
<li>Exceptional support experience. Artie not only offers real-time replication but, to the team’s delight, also provides near real-time support. </li>

<p>With Artie in production, the data team confidently moves business critical dashboards to Snowflake, knowing they have fast and reliable pipelines. This shift also reduces query load on Postgres and MongoDB, resulting in improved application performance. </p>
